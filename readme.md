# Arid Theme

This theme extends Boost and is desgined for use in courses or categories where you want to show generic single-column page information and don't want to show most Moodle site features, such as when using Single Activity courses to display static pages or surveys.

It it not recommended to use this as a site-wide theme. Enable course/category theme support and apply it there only.
